                        <h3>Snorlax</h3>
                        <p>Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its
                            body is composed of mostly its belly, where most of its fat reserves accumulate. Its head is
                            large, with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has large,
                            hind feet with three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and its arms and five foreclaws are
                            short. </p>
                        <p>Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat and seldom for exercises.
                            It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling
                            any ill effects. When hungry, it is not satisfied until it consumes 900 lbs. (400 kg) of food.
                            Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.</p>

                            <h3>Groudon</h3>
                            <p>Groudon is a massive, bipedal, dinosaur-like creature covered in red, segmented plates of thick
                                skin that act as armor. It has a gray underside and large white spikes that run along the
                                sides of its head, body, and tail. It has four claws on each hand, four dozer-like blades
                                on the end of its large tail, and three claws on each foot with grey markings under its feet.
                                It also has blue stripes inside the seams of its armor plating which can only be seen when
                                Groudon is glowing with power. </p>
                            <p> Primal Groudon, its appearance is similar to Groudon, but larger in size. Its skin color changes
                                from dark red to deep crimson with its underside, spikes, and teeth turning black. The blades
                                on its tail are more separated from one another. The Ω symbol is now shown on its arms. Its
                                eyes, the inside of its mouth, and the now-enlarged openings between its armor plating glow
                                bright yellow, and its irises are now red. The energy that fills Primal Groudon pours forth
                                as magma, and it burns with such an extreme temperature that its body is always shimmering
                                with the haze of its heat. In the anime, Primal Groudon is said to create new land with every
                                step it takes.</p>
                            <p>Groudon is an immensely powerful Pokémon, having the ability to summon intense droughts and cause
                                volcanic eruptions. The droughts it can cause allow it to evaporate water, while the volcanic
                                eruptions it can summon enable it to create land. It sleeps underground in large magma chambers.
                                If it encounters its rival, Kyogre, they will engage in a cataclysmic battle. Groudon is
                                the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Precipice Blades.</p>

                            <h3>Rayquaza</h3>
                            <p>Rayquaza is a large, green, serpentine creature. It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its
                                shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow
                                ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow
                                ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat,
                                horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small,
                                yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper
                                jaw.
                            </p>
                            <p>As Mega Rayquaza, its body becomes longer and gains more features. Its head becomes longer with
                                the Δ symbol appearing on its forehead. Its eyes now contain yellow pupils and red irises,
                                and black, tree-like markings trail behind its eyes. Its red lips and teeth become gold,
                                and the gold lines connect to those on its lower horns, which take on a broad, triangular
                                shape. At the outer edges of its lower horns are long, golden, glowing tendrils that each
                                extend to a green, fin-like structure; these tendrils have ring patterns that strongly resemble
                                the yellow markings running along the length of Rayquaza's normal form. Its two upper horns
                                become longer with a gold line running over them in a V shape, and each upper horn has another
                                glowing tendril that ends in a circular shape with a spike. Along the length of its body
                                are golden, glowing orbs placed where its ring patterns used to be. The chin, part of the
                                neck, and parts of its serpentine body are changed to the color black. The fins running along
                                its body are now marked with gold lines; the fins on its tail become entirely yellow and
                                substantially longer. Particles stream from the long tendrils that extend from its jutting
                                jaw; these particles can control the density and humidity of the air, allowing Mega Rayquaza
                                to manipulate the weather. Its green hide sparkles with an emerald-like quality.
                            </p>
                            <p>Inside Rayquaza's body lies an organ that contains the same power as a Mega Stone. A Devon Corporation
                                scientist named this organ the mikado organ (Japanese: ミカド器官). By consuming meteoroids as
                                it flies through the stratosphere, the mikado organ will be filled with enough energy to
                                enable Rayquaza's Mega Evolution. </p>
                            <p> It is able to soothe the other members of the weather trio, even in their Primal Forms. Rayquaza
                                can live for hundreds of millions of years in the ozone layer, where it feeds on water and
                                other particles. Rayquaza is rarely seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable
                                from that of a meteor. Rayquaza is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Dragon
                                Ascent.
